While reading MaryJo Webster's [Beginner Excel tutorial](https://mjwebster.github.io/DataJ/BeginnerExcel.html), follow along by completing these tasks and answering these questions.


When you are done with the tutorial, upload both a Word document with answers to these questions as well as the spreadsheet file that shows your work.

**Questions for the Word doc**

Please just write the numerical answers.

1. How much did all teams pay their players in 2004?

2. How much more (or less) did the Arizona Diamondbacks pay its players in 2016 than it paid in 2011?

3. What team had the largest percent increase in payroll between 2011 and 2016? What was the rate of increase?

4. What team accounted for the largest percentage of MLB payroll in 2016, and what was the percent?

5. What was the average team payroll in 2016?

6. Complete this sentence: "Most teams' total salary in 2016 was more than $________ ."

**Excel Tasks** 

1. Download the Excel spreadsheet file that Webster has linked from her tutorial. Open it and save it as a renamed file.

2. Freeze Column A so you can scroll around your spreadsheet without losing your headers.

3. In cell B33, use the SUM function to calculate the total amount of payroll for all teams in 2002.

4. Now, drag that formula from B33 all the way to the right so you have the total payroll amounts for each year.

5. In cell A33 give your new row a meaningful name

6. In cell J2, calculate the how much more (or less) the Arizona Diamondbacks paid its players in 2016 than it paid in 2011.

7. Fill column J down so that you have calculations of the difference in payroll for each team (and for all teams in Row 32)

8. In cell J1 give your row a meaningful name.

9. In cell K2, calculate the percent increase in the payroll for the Arizona Diamondbacks between 2011 and 2016.

10. Fill column K down so that you have calculations of the increase in payroll for each team (and for all teams in Row 33)

11. In cell K1 give your row a meaningful name.

12. In cell L2, calculate the Diamondbacks payroll divided by the total payroll for 2016.

13. Fill column L down so that you can see the percent of total payroll of each team (and for all teams in Row 33)

14. In cell L1 give your row a meaningful name.

15. In the cells in row 34, calculate the average payroll for each year, and give the row a meaningful name.

16. In the cells in row 35, calculate the median payroll for each year, and give the row a meaningful name

17. Copy the formulas from Column L and paste them into Column M.

18. Now copy the formulas from Column L again and paste them into Column N as just the values of the formulas, not the formulas themselves.

19. Now hide Column M

20. Sort the rows so that the teams are ranked from largest to smallest by the percent increase in player payroll between 2011 and 2016.

21. EXTRA CREDIT: Filter the rows so that just the teams currently in the American League are showing.
